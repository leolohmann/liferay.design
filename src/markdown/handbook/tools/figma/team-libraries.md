# Team Libraries

By default, the ‘Liferay Global’ project contains all of our team libraries. This includes things like Global Utilities (things anyone can use that aren’t project specific — brand colors, wireframing tools, etc) as well as Project or Product specific assets (Experience Cloud components or Liferay.com components) — this is so that we can have all of our assets, components, elements, etc open for all designers to use and improve as they work.

For now, we’re restricting permissions for files in the global project due to Figma’s lack of a formal review process (think Github’s pull-request system). If you’d like to suggest an improvement and new library, please reach out to Emiliano/Victor (Lexicon), Paul (Utilities, general).
