# Sharing & Roles

### Roles

Figma has a very simple permission structure:

-   **Viewer** permissions allow you to view and comment on files
-   **Editor** permissions allow you to create and edit files

In our Liferay account, there is no limit or additional cost for Viewers, Editors cost \$180/year.

We encourage you to give everyone on your project team Viewer roles, this enables transparency and communication in a project.

### Editors Outside of Design

The Editor role is reserved for people whose job role requires the ability to create and edit files — typically this is a designer, but there are a few exceptions — if someone outside of the Design org requests an Editor role, please email [our Figma admin and Juan Hidalgo](mailto:juan.hidalgo@liferay.com?cc=figma@liferay.com) and let them know why you’re adding a new Editor.

### Permission Levels

People can be added on Team, Project, and File levels — you can see any files within that level (i.e. if you’re added to the Lexicon project, you can see all the Lexicon files but you won’t see files in the Liferay.com project).

### Sharing

In Projects and Files there is a blue “Share” button in the upper right corner — click this and add the person’s email into the ‘Invite someone…’ field.

If you have in-depth questions about sharing, please [see Figma’s documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040521453-Share-designs-with-Developer-Handoff) first, if you can’t find an answer there, ask it in the ‘design-operations’ Slack channel.

### Sharing Outside of Liferay

If your project requires adding viewers who don’t have an @liferay.com email address, please add them on a per-file basis. If absolutely necessary, they can be added to a whole project, but use your best judgment to ensure **sensitive information is not shared**.
