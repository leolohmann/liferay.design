## What is [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)?

_A tool that allows us to create and collaborate in wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. For a brief history of why we switched to Figma and how we're using it, [see Paul's article](/articles/2019/design-at-scale-one-year-with-figma/)._

## How do I start using Figma?

1. Thoroughly review this page
1. Contact [Design Operations](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CL2KU6A65) and the team will send an invite to your `@liferay.com` email address
1. Download the [Figma desktop app](https://www.figma.com/downloads)

## Why do we need this document?

-   Project Organization

    -   Problem: Figma has 2 levels of organization, [Projects](#project) and [Files](#files). Large projects can quickly fill with files and be difficult to navigate. \* Solution: Separate your project by parts, leverage the star feature of Figma to only see projects you’re working on in the sidebar. Adhering to the DAM model and golden rules is paramount.

-   Archiving
    -   Problem: Projects will get really bloated if we don’t move files out when we are done with them.
    -   Solution: When any given file is “development complete”, save it out as a ‘.fig’ (⇧⌘S) inside the appropriate folder in the DAM.
    -   Reason: Keep Projects inside Figma organized while maintaining the history.
