## Issues

Issue types exist to distinguish different types of work and help to identify, categorize, and report on each team’s work across Jira. This way tey can help organize and build more structure into the working process of each design team.

Multiple issue types help you search and sort the work your team takes on, track the progress of specific types of work, even estimate how well your team responds to problems or how fast they complete larger work initiatives.

Jira offers default issue types to suit the needs of different projects and teams. It is also possible to customize the issue types to match any method, process, or project management style, as for example Kanban or Scrum.

## Global Issues

#### Epic

High-level request, a large effort of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller pieces: stories or issues. An [epic](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/epic/) can encompass multiple teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple boards.

#### Story

Is a more detailed request, also called user stories more related to a product or service - for example, can be short requirements or requests written from the perspective of a client, a stakeholder, a persona or an end user. A [story](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/story/), or feature, can be the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an end goal expressed from the user's perspective and related to a set of defined tasks. The main purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.

#### Task

A task, as a generic issue, can represent the type of work that needs to be done. This piece of work usually is represented as a normal standalone issue type in Jira. As a single [task](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/task/) should be assigned to one designer and, for example, could be part of a bigger project or initiative.

If a task is too big and complex then the issue (or task) can be broken down into sub-tasks.

## Team Specific Issues

#### Communication Design Request

Request related to the [creation of an asset](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/communication-design-request/) handled by the Communication Team.

#### Lexicon Request

[Request of Liferay's Design System](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/lexicon/) and any demand related to components or technical improvements.

#### User Testing

Request related to [testing](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/user-testing/) a product feature, project or marketing asset by the Research Team.

#### Webinar

Request related to the creation of a [specific webinar](/handbook/tools/jira/issues/webinar/) by the Communication Team.

### Parent, standard, and child issues?

Depending on the complexity of the projects tracked in Jira, you may want to group or nest different work items hierarchically. This can help your teams sweat the details on individual tasks while Scrum masters, project managers, or other team leaders track your team's bigger picture.

**_By default, Jira supports three levels of hierarchy:_**

-   **_Parent issues_** (or epic issues) represent high-level initiatives or bigger pieces of work in Jira. For product teams, a parent issue, or an epic, may represent a new feature in development. For service teams, parent issues may represent a major service request. For some teams, parent issue may represent major deliverables or phases of a project or initiative.

-   **_Standard issues_** represent regular business tasks. In Jira, standard issues are where daily work is discussed and carried out by team members. For product teams, standard issues (like bugs or stories) estimate and track the effort required to build an interaction or other end goal in any project. For service teams, standard issues represent different requests made by customers or stakeholders, like requesting service or support, or reporting problems or blockers with your infrastructure.

-   When needed, **_child issues_** (or subtask issues) can help a team break a standard issue into smaller chunks. This can be helpful if a team underestimates the scope or complexity of their work. Child issues (or subtask issues) can be described and estimated separately to their related standard issue and can help a team better understand and estimate similar work in the future.

## Workflows

_A workflow can be understood as a set of statuses and transitions related to an issue, showing how to move through during its lifecycle and also represents processes within our Jira Design Project._

All Jira projects contain issues that a team can view, work on, and transition through stages of work — from creation to completion. The path that issues take is called a workflow. So each workflow is composed of a set of statuses and transitions that a issue moves through during its lifecycle, and typically represents work processes within the Design Department context.

Also there are **_workflow schemes_** to define the relationship between issue types and workflows. Workflow schemes are associated with a project, and make it possible to use a different workflow for different combinations of project and issue types. It is possible to edit or create a more advanced workflow to match how each team works.
