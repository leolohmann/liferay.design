## One project for DESIGN

- Easier to align processes and workflows
- Reduce cognitive load for Design issue creators
- More efficient project management
- Reduce overhead like technical maintenance

## Jira Issue Types or Rquests

**Epics** can help create roadmaps or relate to one or more project initiatives.
Epics contain different **Stories** related to user needs, JTBD or project context.
Each Story is made of a series of specific **tasks** to be completed.


## Working in Jira

_A Jira project is a collection of issues. Your team could use a Jira project to coordinate the development of a product, track a project, manage a help desk, and more, depending on your requirements. A Jira project can also be configured and customized to suit the needs of you and your team._

_These are our tips to working effectively with Jira at Liferay._
