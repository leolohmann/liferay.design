## 1. Issue Types Overview

Issue types distinguish different types of work in unique ways, and help you identify, categorize, and report on your team’s work across your Jira site. They can help your team build more structure into your working process. 

Multiple issue types help you search and sort the work your team takes on, track the progress of specific types of work, even estimate how well your team responds to bugs or how fast they complete larger initiatives.

Each Jira product comes with default issue types to suit the needs of your projects and teams. You can customize your issue types to match any method of project management you want.

### COMMON ISSUE TYPE PURPOSE

**EPIC**
High-level request, a large effort of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller pieces: stories or issues. An epic can encompass multiple teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple boards.

**MSTORY**
ore detailed request, also called user stories - shor requirements or requests written from the perspective of a client, a stakeholder, a persona or an end user. A user story (or feature) can be the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an end goal expressed from the user's perspective (related to a set of tasks). The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.

**TASK**
A task (or issue) represents work that needs to be done. This piece of work is a normal standalone issue type in Jira. Usually a single task is assigned to one employee. Could be part of a bigger project.

In case a task is too big and complex then the issue/task can be broken down into logical sub-issues known as 'sub-tasks'.


### INDIVIDUAL / SPECIFIC ISSUE TYPE PURPOSE

**LEXICON REQUEST**
Request of Liferay's Design System and any demand related to components or technical improvements.

**USER TESTING**
Request related to testing a product feature, project or marketing asset by the Research Team.

**COMMUNICATION REQUEST**
Request related to the creation of an asset handled by the Communication Team.

**WEBINAR**
Request related to the creation of a specific webinar by the Communication Team.


### What are parent, standard, and child issues?

Depending on the complexity of the projects you track in Jira, you may want to group or nest different work items hierarchically. This can help your teams sweat the details on individual tasks while Scrum masters, project managers, or other team leaders track your team's bigger picture.

***By default, Jira supports three levels of hierarchy:***

- Parent issues (or epic issues) represent high-level initiatives or bigger pieces of work in Jira. For software teams, a parent issue (or epic issue) may represent a new feature they're developing. For IT service teams, parent issues may represent a major service change or upgrade. For business teams, parent issue may represent major deliverables or phases of a project.

- Standard issues represent regular business tasks. In Jira, standard issues are where daily work is discussed and carried out by team members. For software teams, standard issues (like bugs or stories) estimate and track the effort required to build an interaction or other end goal in your team's software. For service teams, standard issues represent different requests made by your team's customers, like requesting service or support, or reporting problems or incidents with your infrastructure. For business teams, standard issues represent and track your team member's daily tasks.

- When needed, child issues (or subtask issues) can help your team break a standard issue into smaller chunks. This can be helpful if your team underestimates the scope or complexity of their work. Child issues (or subtask issues) can be described and estimated separately to their related standard issue and can help your team better understand and estimate similar work in the future.


## 2. Workflow (Map)

### Definition
A set of statuses and transitions linked (or related) to an issue that shows how to move through during its lifecycle and represents processes within our Design Project.

All Jira projects contain issues that your team can view, work on, and transition through stages of work — from creation to completion. The path that your issues take is called a workflow. Each Jira workflow is composed of a set of statuses and transitions that your issue moves through during its lifecycle, and typically represents work processes within your organization.  

In addition, Jira uses workflow schemes to define the relationship between issue types and workflows. Workflow schemes are associated with a project, and make it possible to use a different workflow for different combinations of project and issue types. If you need to edit or create a more advanced workflow to match how your team or organization works,
