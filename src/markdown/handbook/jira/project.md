## Bringing all design teams together

1. Centralization increases productivity [here to find out more](https://liferay.design/handbook/collaborate/)
2. Simplification reduces overhead
3. Visibility improves awareness
4. Integration towards consistent processes
5. Data-informed improves insights

## Three-Phase Approach

1. Simplify project management for design
2. Structure our work consistently
3. Surface work intelligently

Following our design principles, the new and unified Jira Project should be Intentional.

_Eliminate unnecessary complexity. Be easy to understand, regardless of the person's knowledge or concentration level._

Be simple, intuitive and effective.

## One project for DESIGN

- Easier to align processes and workflows
- Reduce cognitive load for Design issue creators
- More efficient project management
- Reduce overhead like technical maintenance

## Jira Issue Types or Rquests

Epics can help create roadmaps or relate to one or more project initiatives
Epics contain different Stories related to user needs, JTBD or project context
Each Story is made of a series of specific tasks to be completed


## Working in Jira

_A Jira project is a collection of issues. Your team could use a Jira project to coordinate the development of a product, track a project, manage a help desk, and more, depending on your requirements. A Jira project can also be configured and customized to suit the needs of you and your team._

These are our four keys to working effectively as a Designer at Liferay.

## Tomorrow

3 common & essential ticket types
Updated issue types renamed for different teams, thus keeping the same process
No relevant change from the requester or user perspective
Better and integrated ticket organization


## 1. Issue Types Overview

COMMON ISSUE TYPE PURPOSE

EPIC
High-level request, a large effort of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller pieces: stories or issues. An epic can encompass multiple teams, on multiple projects, and can even be tracked on multiple boards.

MSTORY
ore detailed request, also called user stories - shor requirements or requests written from the perspective of a client, a stakeholder, a persona or an end user. A user story (or feature) can be the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It's an end goal expressed from the user's perspective (related to a set of tasks). The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.

TASK
A task (or issue) represents work that needs to be done. This piece of work is a normal standalone issue type in Jira. Usually a single task is assigned to one employee. Could be part of a bigger project.

In case a task is too big and complex then the issue/task can be broken down into logical sub-issues known as 'sub-tasks'.


INDIVIDUAL / SPECIFIC ISSUE TYPE PURPOSE

LEXICON REQUEST
Request of Liferay's Design System and any demand related to components or technical improvements.

USER TESTING
Request of Liferay's Design System and any demand related to components or technical improvements.

COMMUNICATION REQUEST
Request related to the creation of an asset handled by the Communication Team.

WEBINAR
Request related to the creation of a specific webinar by the Communication Team.

## 2. Workflow (Map)

Definition
A set of statuses and transitions linked (or related) to an issue that shows how to move through during its lifecycle and represents processes within our Design Project.

All Jira projects contain issues that your team can view, work on, and transition through stages of work â€” from creation to completion. The path that your issues take is called a workflow. Each Jira workflow is composed of a set of statuses and transitions that your issue moves through during its lifecycle, and typically represents work processes within your organization.  

In addition, Jira uses workflow schemes to define the relationship between issue types and workflows. Workflow schemes are associated with a project, and make it possible to use a different workflow for different combinations of project and issue types. If you need to edit or create a more advanced workflow to match how your team or organization works,
