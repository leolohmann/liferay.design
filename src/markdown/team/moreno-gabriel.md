### How did you get into design?

Since I can remember I’ve always been quite creative and quite invested into art (specially renaissance paintings), so one thing led to another, and here I am.


### Why are you at Liferay?

Because it just makes sense.


### Favorite tool?

Figma and the thermomix.


### Best lifehack?

Doing replicas of my plane tickets in Sketch, making them “priority-like”  so I can avoid long queues at the airport. 


### Where do you find #inspiration?

Mostly everywhere, I believe there’s always something to be inspired by.


### One thing you are getting better at?

I’d love to say that my German, but that would be lying so my trekking skills I guess.


### One misconception about Design you try to clear up?

Anyone that knows how to use photoshop can be a designer. Softwares are nothing but a tool, and just like with any tool, the final result is not going to be optimal unless you have the skill, experience, and talent to use it. Does picking up a racket allow anyone to play at the same level as Roger Federer? I don’t think so Karen.


### If you weren’t designing, what would you be doing?

I’d probably be a dentist or working in a Safari in Africa.


### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

Mobile: A picture of me with my dog at the top of a mountain with a pastel sunset on the back.
Desktop: A photo of a Venezuelan Tepui in the Amazonas.


### Favorite place to visit?

London and my grandma's house in Venezuela.


### Favorite superhero?

I’m not really into superheroes however, I do have two real life ones, Irena Sandler & Jacques Jaujard.


### Favorite hotkey?

Control + Option + Command + 8 / Dunno why, but I love inverting the colours of my laptop.


### Advice for ambitious designers?

“The design is not just what it looks like and feels like. The design is how it works” — Steve Jobs


### Last book you read?

The 7 Husbands of Evelyn Hugo


### Most effective productivity booster?

A cuppa coffee and a good Britney song.


### Best interview question?

Would you be willing to bring your dog twice a week to the office?


### What keeps you up at night?

Most of the time TikTok, also a good conversation and a glass of wine.


### Favorite quote?

“Live your life, take chances, be crazy, don’t wait. Because right now is the oldest you’ve ever been and the youngest you’ll be ever again” - Suzanne Collins


### Where can we find you?

Nowhere at all and everywhere if possible.
